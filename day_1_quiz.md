1. A switch. Not a router because routers are used to connect LANs to the Internet and to one and other. Firewalls serve the purpose of filtering malicious traffic implementing rules and protocols, and servers are devices or end hosts which provide data or functionality to a client, not devices which enable interconnectivity within a LAN. Both firewalls and routers typically have less than 30 network interfaces to connect devices to.

2. My friend's phone was functioning as a server. Not a client because in this situation, my device is the client. Not a LAN because LANs don't describe individual devices but rather a set of devices interconnected to one and other via a switch locally.

3. My phone is functioning as a client because it is requesting information from Youtube's server in order to watch the video. It isn't functioning as a server because it is not PROVIDING A SERVICE. My device may be an end host, however the term 'end host' does not refer to it's functionality, it just describes it as a terminal device, a source or destination of data

4. A router. To connect separate networks together, a router is appropriate, since it is designed to connect and forward traffic between multiple networks. A firewall just acts as a filter, not as a device that facilitates interconnectivity.
<br><br>**NOTE:** *A firewall can be placed between multiple network segments and filter traffic between them. Its purpose is not to facilitate communication like a switch or router, but to inspect, allow, or block traffic according to security rules.
A host just describes any device on a network that can receive or send data and has an IP address, it can refer to any type of network node.* 
<br><br>**NOTE:** *the term host encapsulates both servers (hosts that provide services) and clients (hosts that request services). Every server is a host and every client is a host. A host can be both a server and a client.* 
<br><br>A LAN describes a set of devices locally interconnected by, usually, a switch.

5. Why is a next-generation firewall the best type of firewall for a company that wants to upgrade an old network firewall? 
It is not a host-based firewall because host-based firewalls do not protect networks, but individual devices. In order to protect every device in the network one host-based firewall would have to be installed on every device.
"Next-level firewalls" and "top-layer firewalls" are not actual types of firewalls. 
A next-generation firewall combines traditional firewall features with more advanced filtering functionalities, such as filtering what servers can deliver data and which ones can't (allowing access to certain websites but not others) or inspecting the contents of incoming packets rather than just the headers that include essential routing info
